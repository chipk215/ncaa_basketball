The goal is to generate the massey_seasons_with_id.csv file with 9 specific computer rankings for each season beginning with 2003.
The team names and Kaggle IDs should match Kaggle data.

1. Using main.py generate rankings_season.csv file.
For 2019 the RPI ranking is no longer included in the Massey ratings.
Since RPI was dropped in our LR model anyway, we'll not include RPI as a computer ranking.

2. Modify combine.py to incorporate seasons to be included in processing.
combine.py drops computer rankings not common to all seasons.
The output is combined_seasons.csv.

3. Execute join_with_kaggle_id.py to adjust team names and add kaggle ids
Output is massey_seasons_with_id.csv
